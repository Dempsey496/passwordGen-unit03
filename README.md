# passwordGen-unit03

# Design 

* I started off by thinking about the layout I wanted to achieve for this homework. Most of the style for the body was already created, all I needed to add were the user prompts to include different aspects in the password.

* I knew I was going to do either _check-box_ or _switch_ options for the user to choose what to include. After looking online I found a simple check-box style to add to the HTML.

# Elements & basic functions

* My next step was to look at all the HTML ID's and create corresponding elements in JS.

* The next functions I created were to create the corresponding checkbox elements.

* I then created the -const- variables to perminately assign their values.
