# passwordGen-unit03

# Walkthrough
* Once the "generate password" button is clicked, the user is prompted to choose both password length and the characters to include in their password. The user will be able to choose from __lowercase__, __uppercase__, __symbols__, and __numbers__. I also added a _copy password to clipboard_ button to make transferring password a little more user friendly.

***
