* My goal with this site was to give the user an easy, quick password. They will be able to specify the length and what type of characters was included in their password.

# Walkthrough
* Once user clicks the generate button they will be asked how long they want the password to be.
* After length is choosen, user must confirm if they wish to include different characters in their password.
* Generated password will be displayed in area provided.

# Bugs
* I was having a lot of trouble clearing the old password if the generate button was clicked a second time. I was finally able to fix it by making _newPassword = ""_.




Need to clear past passwords when button is clicked again
